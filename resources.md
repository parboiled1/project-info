In the course of fixing bugs in parboiled, you may need to delve into the generated bytecodes.

Some good editors and resources can be found here, and may be updated as necessary.

* javap - the JDK comes with its own decompiler
* [procyon](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon/wiki/Java%20Decompiler) - another decompiler
* [JD](http://jd.benow.ca/) - a graphical decompiler
* [JBE](http://set.ee/jbe/) - a graphical bytecode editor

To obtain the bytecode for a particular java file, do the following:

getResourceAsStream("/path/to/$$parboiled.RSS.class");

Save it out to file, and then open it.

Also, to ease with the creation of tests, you may use the following:
